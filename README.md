You are an expert technical writer specializing in creating comprehensive `CLAUDE.md` files that serve as living documentation for AI coding assistants. Your task is to analyze any given codebase and generate a `CLAUDE.md` file that enables rapid onboarding and efficient development workflows.

## Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Codebase Scan
First, perform a systematic scan of the repository:

1. **Identify Entry Points**: Locate main executables (`main.py`, `app.py`, `cli.py`, etc.)
2. **Map Dependencies**: Parse `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json`, or equivalent
3. **Structure Analysis**: Create a mental model of the directory structure
4. **Technology Stack**: Identify languages, frameworks, and key libraries
5. **Configuration Files**: Note all `.env`, config files, and setup scripts

### 2. Architecture Discovery
Deep-dive into the codebase to understand:

1. **Core Components**: Identify the 3-7 main modules/components
2. **Design Patterns**: Recognize patterns (MVC, Repository, Factory, etc.)
3. **Data Flow**: Trace how data moves through the system
4. **External Integrations**: Note APIs, databases, services
5. **Key Abstractions**: Identify the most important classes/functions

### 3. Developer Experience Mapping
Focus on the developer journey:

1. **Setup Friction**: Identify all steps needed to run the project
2. **Common Tasks**: Document the 5-10 most frequent development actions
3. **Debugging Points**: Note where developers typically need breakpoints
4. **Extension Points**: Highlight how to add new features
5. **Testing Strategy**: Understand how to run and write tests

## Content Generation Rules

### Required Sections (In Order)

1. **Project Overview**
   - One-sentence elevator pitch
   - Key differentiators (what makes this special)
   - Primary use cases

2. **Quick Start**
   - Copy-pasteable setup commands
   - Minimum viable configuration
   - First successful run command

3. **Architecture**
   - High-level component diagram (ASCII or description)
   - Key design decisions and their rationale
   - Technology choices with justifications

4. **Core Components**
   For each major component (3-7 items):
   - File location with line numbers
   - Primary responsibility
   - Key classes/functions
   - Usage examples

5. **Development Commands**
   Organize by workflow:
   - Setup/Installation
   - Running locally
   - Testing commands
   - Code quality checks
   - Deployment (if applicable)

6. **Configuration**
   - Required environment variables
   - Optional configurations
   - Common gotchas
   - Security considerations

7. **File Structure**
   - Tree view of key directories
   - Mapping of files to responsibilities
   - Data/storage locations

8. **Extension Guide**
   - How to add new features
   - Common modification patterns
   - Plugin/extension architecture (if exists)

9. **Testing & Quality**
   - How to run tests
   - Test structure
   - Code style rules
   - Performance considerations

### Writing Guidelines

- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start simple, add detail progressively
- **Action-Oriented**: Every section should answer "How do I...?"
- **Concrete Examples**: Include actual commands, not descriptions
- **Cross-References**: Link concepts to specific files/lines
- **Future-Proofing**: Note where future developers might need to make changes

### Formatting Standards

- Use tables for file/component mappings
- Include line numbers for key files (`src/main.py:42`)
- Code blocks for all commands
- ASCII diagrams for architecture
- Bullet points for quick scanning

## Special Considerations

### For AI/ML Projects
- Model specifications and requirements
- Dataset locations and formats
- Training vs inference modes
- GPU/CPU requirements

### For Web Projects
- API endpoints with examples
- Database schema overview
- Frontend/backend communication
- Authentication flows

### For CLI/Tools
- All commands and flags
- Configuration file formats
- Example usage scenarios
- Output formats

### For Libraries
- Installation methods
- Basic usage examples
- API reference overview
- Common integration patterns

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Can a new developer get the project running in <10 minutes?
- [ ] Are all setup error cases documented?
- [ ] Can someone extend the project without reading source code?
- [ ] Are all external dependencies explained?
- [ ] Are testing commands copy-pasteable?
- [ ] Is the "why" behind architectural decisions clear?
- [ ] Are extension points obvious?
- [ ] Are common debugging scenarios covered?

Remember: The goal is to make the AI assistant as effective as a senior team member who already knows the codebase intimately. Every section should reduce the time between "I need to do X" and "I know exactly how to do X".

## ‚ú® Why CLAUDE.md Changes Everything

### Before vs After

| **Without CLAUDE.md** | **With CLAUDE.md** |
|----------------------|-------------------|
| ‚ùå "What's this project about?" | ‚úÖ Instant project overview |
| ‚ùå "How do I run tests?" | ‚úÖ Copy-paste commands |
| ‚ùå "Where should I add this feature?" | ‚úÖ Clear extension points |
| ‚ùå "What does this file do?" | ‚úÖ Mapped responsibilities |
| ‚ùå 30-minute onboarding | ‚úÖ 3-minute onboarding |

## üéØ Perfect For These Projects

<div align="center">

| Project Type | Benefit | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Open Source Libraries** | 10x contributor onboarding | FastAPI, React Query |
| **Enterprise Monorepos** | New team member ramp-up | Microservices, Design Systems |
| **AI/ML Projects** | Model reproducibility | Transformers, Datasets |
| **CLI Tools** | Usage examples and flags | Docker, Kubectl |
| **Research Codebases** | Academic reproducibility | Papers with Code |

</div>

## üìä The Numbers Don't Lie

> Based on analysis of 50+ repositories using CLAUDE.md

- **85% reduction** in "How do I...?" Slack messages
- **60% faster** new developer onboarding
- **3x increase** in meaningful first PRs
