awesome job! please put on your deep-thinking hat to deeply and thoroughly explore carefully and systematically for the various implementation options to re-imagine an awesome, comprehensive and attention attracting `README.md` for the GitHub repository to share your awesome master prompt to generate a CLAUDE.md file for a given codebase. then choose the best implementation option to create the "re-imagined" `README.md`. remember to plan carefully before proceeding to execute meticulously. please try your very best so as not to disappoint me. thank you and good luck!

please do a deep dive research on how a meta prompt should be crafted to instruct an AI coding assistant how to generate a `CLAUDE.md` file for a given project codebase. below is a skeleton of a typical `CLAUDE.md` file that the *Claude Code* coding agent will use to populate the content specific to the given codebase. please use deep dive research to look for more `CLAUDE.md` samples from various GitHub repositories, then use the deep insights from how these CLAUDE.md samples are structure and what content or details about the related project are captured and summarized in the `CLAUDE.md` file. then create a meta prompt that a LLM will follow to generate the `CLAUDE.md` for any given project codebase.
